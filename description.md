##Scanning Radar
A radar that actually scans in a sweeping arc. Massive power requirements. 
Initial version, may still need a bit of polish.

Default settings to scan about the same area as the vanilla radar though much faster, can be increased or decreased to experiment.
A change to the radius takes effect after the radar is picked and replaced
If a large radius is used, the initial scan can be slow. Afterwards the speed picks back up
